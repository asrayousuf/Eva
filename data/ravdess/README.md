1. Run the `get_ravdess_data.sh` bash script. This will download the RAVDESS data and extract frames from the videos.
2. The `xml` files are required to run a model to detect whether the actors within the image have their eyes open and have their faces looking directly at the camera.
    - Blurry images or images with actors having their eyes closed have been removed from the dataset.
